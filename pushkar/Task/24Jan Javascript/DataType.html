    <h1>data Types in JavaScript are as:- <br>
    </h1>
    <pre>
    1):-Number Type
    2):-Boolena
    3):-String
    4):-Null
    5):-Object
    6):- Undefiend
    </pre>
    <pre>
        1):-String is used to store text. In JavaScript, strings are surrounded by quotes
        2):-Number represents integer and floating numbers (decimals and exponentials). For example 10,20.22
        3):-Boolean is data type represents logical entities. Boolean represents one of two values: true or false. It is easier to think of it as a yes/no switch. For example, true false
        4):-In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents empty or unknown value.
        5):-An object is a complex data type that allows us to store collections of data.
        6):-The undefined data type represents value that is not assigned. If a variable is declared but the value is not assigned, then the value of that variable will be undefined.
